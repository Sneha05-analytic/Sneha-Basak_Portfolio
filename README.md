[Project1: BIG MARKET SALES PREDICTION](https://github.com/Sneha05-analytic/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/BIG%20MARKET%20sales%20prediction.ipynb)

> The data scientists at BigMart have collected 2013 sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities.
> Also, certain attributes of each product and store have been defined. 
> The aim is to build a predictive model and find out the sales of each product at a particular store.
> Using this model, BigMart will try to understand the properties of products and stores which play a key role in increasing sales.

[Project2:LOAN PREDICTION ANALYSIS (Classification)](https://github.com/Sneha05-analytic/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Loan%20prediction%20analysis%20%2Cclassification.ipynb)

> Dream Housing Finance company deals in all home loans. They have presence across all urban, semi urban and rural areas. Customer first apply for home loan after that company       validates the customer eligibility for loan. 
> Company wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real time) based on customer detail provided while filling online application form.
> These details are Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History and others. 
> To automate this process, they have given a problem to identify the customers segments, those are eligible for loan amount so that they can specifically target these customers.
> This is a standard supervised classification task.A classification problem where we have to predict whether a loan would be approved or not. Below is the dataset attributes with   description.

[Project3:TURKEY STUDENT EVALUATION (Clustering)](https://github.com/Sneha05-analytic/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Turkey%20student%20evaluation%20.ipynb)

> Data set contains a total 5820 evaluation scores provided by students from Gazi University in Ankara (Turkey). There is a total of 28 course specific questions and additional 5   attributes.
> Now evaluation form filled out by students for different courses. It has different attributes including attendance, difficulty, score for each evaluation question, among           others.
> This is a standard clustering task.We concluded that using data of student evaluation for courses is useful to predict the factors that affect their
  achievement 
> Predict instructors’ performance. Moreover, it is another point of view to improve educational quality which is vital to attract students while most of the researchers used CGPA   and internal assessment attributes to predict students’ performance to enhance educational system. 
> Furthermore removing the worst ranked attributes that have a lower impact on dataset increased the algorithms performance accuracies.

[Project4:VACCINE USAGE PREDICTION (Logistic Regression](https://github.com/Sneha05-analytic/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Vaccine%20Usage%20Prediction%20LOGISTIC%20REGRESSION.ipynb)

> Subjects receiving the same vaccine often show different levels of immune responses and some may even present adverse side effects to the vaccine. Systems vaccinology can       combine omics data and machine learning techniques to obtain highly predictive signatures of vaccine immunogenicity and reactogenicity. Currently, several machine learning       methods are already available to researchers with no background in bioinformatics
> Predict how likely it is that the people will take an H1N1 flu vaccine using Logistic Regression.
