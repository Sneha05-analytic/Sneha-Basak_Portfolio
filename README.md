[Project1: BIG MARKET SALES PREDICTION](https://github.com/Sneha05-analytic/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/BIG%20MARKET%20sales%20prediction.ipynb)
->The data scientists at BigMart have collected 2013 sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities. 
->Also, certain attributes of each product and store have   been defined. 
->The aim is to build a predictive model and find out the sales of each product at a particular store.
->Using this model, BigMart will try to understand the properties of products and stores which play a key role in increasing sales.
