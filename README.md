[Project1: BIG MARKET SALES PREDICTION](https://github.com/Sneha05-analytic/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/BIG%20MARKET%20sales%20prediction.ipynb)
 
> The aim is to build a predictive model and find out the sales of each product at a particular store.
> Using this model, BigMart will try to understand the properties of products and stores which play a key role in increasing sales.

[Project2: 50 STARTUP PROFIT PREDICTION](https://github.com/Sneha05-analytic/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/50%20STARTUP%20PROFIT%20PREDICTION%202.ipynb)

> Objective is to compare and predict the profit of 50 startup for different state and after succefully analysing deploy it to power bi for effective visualization.

[Project3:LOAN PREDICTION ANALYSIS (Classification)](https://github.com/Sneha05-analytic/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Loan%20prediction%20analysis%20%2Cclassification.ipynb)

> To automate this process, they have given a problem to identify the customers segments, those are eligible for loan amount so that they can specifically target these customers.
> This is a standard supervised classification task.A classification problem where we have to predict whether a loan would be approved or not. Below is the dataset attributes with   description.

[Project4:TURKEY STUDENT EVALUATION (Clustering)](https://github.com/Sneha05-analytic/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Turkey%20student%20evaluation%20.ipynb)

> This is a standard clustering task.We concluded that using data of student evaluation for courses is useful to predict the factors that affect their
  achievement 
> Predict instructors’ performance. Moreover, it is another point of view to improve educational quality which is vital to attract students while most of the researchers used CGPA   and internal assessment attributes to predict students’ performance to enhance educational system. 
> Furthermore removing the worst ranked attributes that have a lower impact on dataset increased the algorithms performance accuracies.

[Project5:VACCINE USAGE PREDICTION (Logistic Regression)](https://github.com/Sneha05-analytic/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Vaccine%20Usage%20Prediction%20LOGISTIC%20REGRESSION.ipynb)

> Predict how likely it is that the people will take an H1N1 flu vaccine using Logistic Regression.

[Project6:TRAFFIC FORECASTING BY TIME SERIES ANALYSIS](https://github.com/Sneha05-analytic/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Traffic%20forecasting%20by%20Time%20series%20analysis.ipynb)

> They usually invest in B2C start-ups less than 4 years old looking for pre-series A funding. In order to help Unicorn Ventures in their decision, I need to forecast the           traffic on JetRail for the next 7 months.

[Project7: TWITTER SENTIMENT Analysis- NLP](https://github.com/Sneha05-analytic/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Twitter%20sentiment%20analysis-%20NLP%20.ipynb)

> The objective of this task is to detect hate speech in tweets. For the sake of simplicity, we say a tweet contains hate speech if it has a racist or sexist sentiment             associated  with it. So, the task is to classify racist or sexist tweets from other tweets.
